Docker configs are only available to swarm services, not to standalone containers. 
Configs allow you to store non-sensitive data information, such as configuration files, outside a service’s image or running containers. 
This allows you to keep your images as generic as possible, without the need to bind-mount configuration files into the containers or use environment variables. 
Configs operate in a similar way to secrets, except that they are not encrypted at rest and are mounted directly into the container’s filesystem without the use of RAM disks. 
Configs can be added or removed from a service at any time, and services can share a config.
