If you run Docker on your nodes, you can configure the Docker container runtime to authenticate to a private container registry.
On your laptop, you must authenticate with a registry in order to pull a private image.
Use the 'docker' tool to log in to Docker Hub.
Docker stores keys for private registries in the "$HOME/.dockercfg" (OR) "$HOME/.docker/config.json" file.

$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub.
Username: DOCKER_HUB_USER_ID
Password: DOCKER_HUB_USER_PASSWORD
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/ubuntu/.docker/config.json.
Login Succeeded

When prompted, enter your Docker ID, and then the credential you want to use (access token, or the password for your Docker ID).
The login process creates or updates a config.json file that holds an authorization token.
View the config.json file:

$ cat ~/.docker/config.json
{
    "auths": {
        "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
            "auth": "YXJ1bnRoZWphMjE6QXJ1bnRoZWphJCMyMQ=="
        }
    }
}

$ docker logout
Removing login credentials for https://index.docker.io/v1/

$ cat ~/.docker/config.json
{
        "auths": {}
}
