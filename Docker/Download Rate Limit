Docker Hub limits the number of Docker image downloads (“pulls”) based on the account type of the user pulling the image.
Pull rates limits are based on individual IP address.
For anonymous users, the rate limit is set to 100 pulls per 6 hours per IP address.
For authenticated users, it is 200 pulls per 6 hour period.
Users with a paid Docker subscription, it is up to 5000 pulls per day.
